# Current State of KupuKupu

## Application Overview

KupuKupu is being developed as both a web application and an Electron desktop application, using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application is designed to run in multiple environments while maintaining consistent functionality. No Typescript will be used. No frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, etc. will be used.

## Environment Support

### Web Browser

-   Served via Vite development server in development
-   Can be deployed to any web server in production
-   Entry point: `src/pages/index.html`

### Electron Desktop

-   Runs as a native desktop application
-   Uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for secure main process operations
-   Entry points:
    -   Main Process: `src/electron.js`
    -   Preload Script: `src/preload.cjs`
    -   Renderer Process: `src/pages/index.html`

## Current Architecture

### IPC System

-   Located in `src/ipc/`
-   Modular handler system for different functionalities
-   Currently implemented handlers:
    -   Storage (`src/ipc/handlers/store.js`)
    -   Events (`src/ipc/handlers/events.js`)

### Storage System

-   Uses `electron-store` in Electron environment
-   Uses `localStorage` in web browser environment
-   Provides a consistent API across all environments:

    ```javascript
    // Get an instance of the storage interface
    const storage = new Storage();

    // Available methods
    storage.get(key);
    storage.set(key, value);
    storage.delete(key);
    storage.clear();
    storage.has(key);
    ```

-   Comprehensive documentation available in JSDoc format
-   Environment detection working correctly via preload script

### Event System

-   Located in `src/assets/js/pubsub.js`
-   Built on top of `mitt` for efficient event handling
-   Cross-environment support:
    -   Browser: In-memory event handling
    -   Electron: Cross-window event propagation via IPC
-   Features:
    -   Event deduplication in Electron
    -   Automatic cleanup of processed events
    -   Consistent async/sync behavior
-   Example usage:

    ```javascript
    import { pubsub } from './pubsub.js';

    // Subscribe to events
    pubsub.on('settingsChanged', (data) => {
    	console.log('Settings changed:', data);
    });

    // Publish events
    await pubsub.emit('settingsChanged', { theme: 'dark' });
    ```

### Notifications System

-   Located in `src/assets/js/notifications.js`
-   Built on top of `notyf` for efficient toast notifications
-   Cross-environment support:
    -   Browser: Standard notifications
    -   Electron: Cross-window notification propagation via PubSub
-   Features:
    -   Success, error, and warning notification types
    -   Customizable duration and dismissible options
    -   Reduced motion support
    -   Theme-aware styling using CSS variables
    -   Deduplication in Electron windows
-   Example usage:

    ```javascript
    import { notify } from './notifications.js';

    // Simple usage
    notify.success('Settings saved successfully');
    notify.error('Failed to save settings');
    notify.warning('You have unsaved changes');

    // Advanced usage
    notify.show({
    	message: 'Custom notification',
    	type: 'warning',
    	duration: 0, // Won't auto-dismiss
    	dismissible: true,
    });
    ```

### Utility System

-   Located in `src/utils/`
-   Modular structure with individual utility files
-   Central index for clean imports
-   Currently implemented utilities:
    -   Environment detection (`environment.js`)
        -   `isElectron()`: Checks for Electron runtime
        -   `getEnvironment()`: Returns current environment name
-   Usage:

    ```javascript
    import { isElectron } from '../utils';

    if (isElectron()) {
    	// Electron-specific code
    }
    ```

## Pending Tasks

### High Priority

1. Basic App Layout

    - Implement narrow left sidebar with icons
    - Pages to include:
        - Home (main feed view)
        - Today (daily reading list)
        - Settings
        - User Profile (fixed to bottom)
    - Select appropriate icons for each page
    - Implement main content area
    - Ensure responsive design
    - Support for reduced motion and accessibility

2. Documentation
    - Development setup guide
    - Deployment procedures
    - Component documentation

### Low Priority

1. Development Tools
    - Add development utilities
    - Implement debugging helpers

## Build Processes

### Development

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server for web development
-   `npm run electron:dev`: Runs both the Vite dev server and Electron app concurrently
-   `npm run preview`: Previews the built web application
-   `npm run electron:preview`: Previews the built Electron application

### Production

-   `npm run build`: Builds the web application using Vite
-   `npm run electron:build`: Builds both the web application and packages the Electron app

## Build Configuration

-   Uses Vite for web bundling
-   Uses electron-builder for desktop packaging
-   Supports both macOS and Windows builds
-   ASAR packaging enabled for production builds

## Known Issues

None.
